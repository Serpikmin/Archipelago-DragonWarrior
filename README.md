## What does randomization do to this game?

By default, chests and their contents are randomized into the multiworld. There are also two checks associated with rescuing and returning Princess Gwaelin.

Magic Key Vendors no longer sell them, instead, a single unbreakable Magic Key is shuffled into the multiworld as a progression item.

In order to beat the game, you must collect the Staff of Rain, Stones of Sunlight, and Erdrick's Token in order to receive the Rainbow Drop and reach Charlock Castle. The completion condition is to defeat the Dragonlord. Erdrick's Token is in it's vanilla spot if `Searchsanity` is disabled.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Quest items including the Magic Key get shuffled, as well as many filler items like herbs and gold. If `Shopsanity` is enabled, Progressive Equipment Items are also added to the progression item pool.

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Dragon Warrior?

All items appear in chests and search spots as "APItem". Levelups, Purchases, and Monster Kills do not have an explicit appearence and simply send a check out when achieved.

Currently, items are silently added to the player's inventory. If the player's inventory is full, a quest item will drop a filler item (Similar to the logic for Gwaelin's Love).
